-  This is the ReadMe file of the assignment for the course Computer Science for Business Analytics from the Erasmus School of Economics.
-  The code contains all the steps necessary to retrieve the results including: datacleaning, the creation of a binary matrix, LSH, MSM including the distance matrix, and the evaluation of performance. These steps are all clearly highlighted.

Installation:

-  Set up conda environment using Python 3.11.9 (I used Spyder).
-  Upload the json file and change to own path.
-  Install required packages using "pip install 'required package' ".

All steps can be performed in this single file. Note that the running times may be long.
